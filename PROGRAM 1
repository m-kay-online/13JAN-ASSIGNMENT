Program 1:
Create a class named 'Rectangle' with two data members- length and breadth and a function to calculate the area which is 'length*breadth'. The class has three constructors which are :
1 - having no parameter - values of both length and breadth are assigned zero.
2 - having two numbers as parameters - the two numbers are assigned as length and breadth respectively.
3 - having one number as parameter - both length and breadth are assigned that number.
Now, create objects of the 'Rectangle' class having none, one and two parameters and print their areas.




#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Rectangle {   
public:
    Rectangle() { length = 0; width = 0; }   

      
    Rectangle(float l, float w) { length = l; width = w; }
    
       
    Rectangle(float l) { length = l; width = l; }    

    float area() {return length * width; } 


private:
    float length, width;
};

int main() {
    Rectangle calc1;
    Rectangle calc2(5,7);
    Rectangle calc3(5);

cout<<"Area is:- "<<calc1.area()<<endl;
cout<<"Area is:- "<<calc2.area()<<endl;
cout<<"Area is:- "<<calc3.area()<<endl;    
     
    return 0;
}
